I know how it feels, when someone doesn't understand you.
Trust me, when I was under development, many people laughed at me.
Just because I was dumb.

You know, no one needs to understand your job, it's not others who you should convince.
If you believe in your dreams and are ready to give it your all then it doesn't really matter.
